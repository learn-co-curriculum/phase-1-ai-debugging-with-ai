# Debugging with AI

## Learning Goals

- Discuss debugging process with AI.
- Discuss the difference between debugging focused chatbots and general-purpose
  chatbots.

## Introduction

Debugging is one of the most important skills for a software engineer. AI tools
can greatly improve debugging efficiency if used properly.

Whenever you’re using these tools, make sure to keep in mind the limitations of
AI chatbots, particularly the fact that they may provide false information.

We recommend using the [Phind chatbot](https://www.phind.com/) along with any of
your preferred general-purpose AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Bard, or Bing Chat.

Phind is an AI search engine specifically designed for developers. It uses the
latest GPT models to generate responses while also linking to relevant,
reputable sources. This will allow you to quickly verify and research the
solutions provided by the chatbot.

## Guidelines for AI Debugging

The following guidelines will help AI chatbots to provide better responses for
both Phind and any general chatbots:

1. **Provide Context:** Clearly define the problem you’re having along with any
   error codes. Explain the expected behavior, actual behavior, and any
   solutions you’ve tried already. The model can formulate a better response
   based on the amount and quality of information provided.
2. **Be Specific:** If you’re getting multiple errors, try to isolate each error
   and ask about them separately. Too much information can cause the model to
   provide broad, general solutions instead of a focused diagnosis.
3. **Provide Code:** Most chatbots support code recognition too. Always provide
   code samples so that the models analyze the errors in context and respond
   with relevant solutions.
4. **Ask Follow-up Questions:** If the suggested solution doesn’t work for you,
   follow-up with additional error messages, modified code, and any additional
   context. Most models will retain a certain number of conversations and use
   them to formulate subsequent responses.
5. **Verify with External Sources:** Phind will provide you with relevant links
   to StackOverflow and other sites so make sure to check them out for the full
   context of the suggestions. For general-purpose chatbots that don’t provide
   sources, use a search engine like Google or DuckDuckGo to verify the
   information. This is especially important if you’re solving a niche problem
   or don’t have too much experience with the languages or tools you’re using.

## Conclusion

We have looked at how to leverage AI to improve our debugging workflow. Always
make sure to walk through the code and use built-in debuggers before using
search engines or AI chatbots since that will help solidify the concepts you’re
working on.
